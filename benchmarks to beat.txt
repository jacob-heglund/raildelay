[10] - basic regression model
RMSE: 17, 8.4, 7.7 minutes

[12] - RNN to predict INDIVIDUAL train delay at next station given data at all previous stations in it's journey
average abs. difference =
1.4 minutes for 1-step prediction (i.e. "next stop" delay prediction)
3.4 minutes for 10-step prediction

our model is better though, b/c we are able to model the dependencies between train delays in a non-parametric manner
- i.e. we aren't specifying the specific trains that will affect our train, we simple let the graph structure do it's thing to propagate the dependencies
